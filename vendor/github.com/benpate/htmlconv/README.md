## Pull Requests Welcome

Original versions of this library have been used in production on commercial applications for years, and the extra data collection has been a tremendous help for everyone involved.

I'm now open sourcing this library, and others, with hopes that you'll also benefit from a more robust error package.

Please use GitHub to make suggestions, pull requests, and enhancements.  We're all in this together! ðŸ¤ª
