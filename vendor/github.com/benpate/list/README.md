## Simple List-Manipulation Utilities for Go

This library doesn't do anything earth-shattering, but it DOES replicate a number of useful functions that I miss from other languages.  Feel free to use, or add to this library accordingly.

## Pull Requests Welcome

This library is a work in progress, and will benefit from your experience reports, use cases, and contributions.  If you have an idea for making Rosetta better, send in a pull request.  We're all in this together!
