## JSON to HTML (Forms for Go)

This expandable [Go module](https://golang.org) generates HTML forms using JSON configurations.  It is inspired by JSON-Forms but is not compatable with that standard.

## DO NOT USE
This project is a work-in-progress, and should NOT be used by ANYONE, for ANY PURPOSE, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  It is NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME, and is essentially GUARANTEED to blow up your computer, send your cat into an infinite loop, and combine your hot and cold laundry into a single cycle.

## Pull Requests Welcome
