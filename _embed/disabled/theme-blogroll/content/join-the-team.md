# Join The Team!

Hi, I'm Ben, and I'm on a mission to make the Internet better and more inclusive with a better kind of software.  People deserve social networks that serve them, not some Venture Capitalist's balance sheet.  People deserve to communicate on their own terms, without tracking, without SPAM, and without extremism-inducing algorithms that favor "engagement" over common decency.  Emissary is one of many projects that aims to fix this.  

## But Why Emissary?
Emissary sits apart from the apps already out there because it is not just a single app, but a complete development environment for making trustworthy social apps.  Developers and designers can work together to make all kinds of social apps from blogs to photo-sharing, groupware, and more.  All within a simple, low-code environment that makes "good" code incredibly easy, and "bad" code incredibly difficult.

## Connecting the Whole Web
Emissary treats RSS feeds and the Indie-Web as first-class actors right alongside every other Fediverse/ActivityPub service, so you can friend, follow, comment and like the whole web, not just parts of it.  As more open protocols join the party, we'll add them into Emissary, so nobody is left behind.

## Help Wanted, No Really...
You can probably tell that things are a little barren here right now, but they won't always be.  I'm working hard to bring Emissary to life, one line of Copilot-generated code at a time.  There's a lot to do, and I could really use your help.

For now, the best way to help is to try it out and [ask questions on GitHub](https://github.com/EmissarySocial/emissary/issues).  Make Emissary your own.  I'll compile a list of easy projects for new developers to tackle, and together we can build something amazing.
