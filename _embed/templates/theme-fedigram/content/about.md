# Fedigram: Photo Sharing Without All The Creepy Stuff

Fedigram is personal photo-sharing theme optimized for a single person, giving you an easy way to start uploading and sharing photos with the general public, or a small group of friends and family.  Like other default Emissary themes, it includes light and dark modes that fade into the background to let your photos shine.  And, like everything in Emissary, it comes with zero surveillance, tracking, or privacy invasions -- just you, your photos, and your community.
