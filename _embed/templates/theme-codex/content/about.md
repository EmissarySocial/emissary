# Codex: Side-Navigation for Your Magnum Opus

Codex is a general-purpose theme with a large side navigation bar for organizing big websites.  It works with any number of active users, and includes light and dark modes that fade into the background to let your content shine.  Codex is a companion of the default Minimus theme, and tends to get updates more quickly than others.
