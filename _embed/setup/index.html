				IMPORTANT: This app <b class="text-red">is not password protected</b>, so it should only be run
				from a private, trusted machine, and NOT from a publicly available server.  Once
				you have configured your Emissary instance, you can turn off the console.  It does
				not need to be running for Emissary to work.
