/*
Package tools contains.. yep, tools.  These are a bunch of small
libraries that are just important enough to need their own
packages, but not big enough to deserve their own separate repositories.

Some day, each of these should *probably* by moved into a separate
repository, but during development the cost of adding another external
dependency just isn't worth it.
