## This is a work-in-progress / proof-of-concept project that is guaranteed to NOT work for anyone, in any capacity, at any time.  Do not use this code in production, in development, or even in theory, because it's all wrong and may never be corrected, maintained, or supported.

# What is Ghost?

Ghost is a placeholder name (that is very likely to change before any meaningful release) for a new kind of messaging platform that combines real-time updates with permanent, searchable data.

Project plan

1. Model core objects and organize the idea of what Ghost should be.
2. Proof-of-concept client, using Typescript, LitElement, and Rollup.js
3. Proof-of-concept server that passes plaintext messages between clients.
4. Iterate on Client and Server designs
5. Add encryption to client and server interfaces.
6. Polish onboarding and usability of client.
7. ???
8. Profit.
